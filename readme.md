# Toshokan (Âõ≥Êõ∏È§®)

A minimalist PDF reader and library manager focused on simplicity and productivity. Built with SDL3 and MuPDF.

*Toshokan (Âõ≥Êõ∏È§®, „Å®„Åó„Çá„Åã„Çì) means "library" in Japanese, reflecting the project's goal of organizing and managing your digital book collection.*

## Project Vision

Toshokan was born from a common problem: having so many PDF books that you lose track of what you have. It aims to solve the "digital bookshelf overflow" where PDFs accumulate across folders, making it hard to discover and remember what you've collected.

Think of it as "Sublime Text for PDFs" - not just another PDF reader, but a tool to help you:
- Rediscover books you forgot you had
- Actually find that paper you remember downloading months ago
- Keep your reading organized without complex folder structures
- Make meaningful connections between related documents

### Key Features

- **Multi-tab Support**: Open the same PDF in multiple tabs, similar to how text editors work
- **Deep-linked Annotations**: Bookmarks, highlights, and notes that reference specific locations in PDFs
- **Clean UI**: Minimalist interface focused on reading and navigation
- **Fast Navigation**: Quick access to your PDF collection
- **Library Management**: Help you organize and find your accumulated PDFs

## Technical Stack

- **SDL3**: Cross-platform windowing and input handling
- **MuPDF**: PDF rendering engine
- **Clay**: UI layout system
- **Custom Build System**: On-demand compilation with hot reload support
